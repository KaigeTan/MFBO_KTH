## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `mtgp-master`: This directory contains all of the function used in the MTBO. 

- `results`: This directory contains offline training results of the hyperparameters.

- `MFGP_main.m`: This m function file is to train SoftQ with online data.

- `CPG_online.slx`: This .slx files contains simulink model used for SoftQ online training.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
