## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `Simulink_models`: This directory contains all Simulink files, including soft robot plant models and CPG oscillators.

- `data`: This directory contains generated data files for 1) offline training results, 2) benchmark method testing, and 3) prerequest data for online training.

- `mtgp-master`: This directory contains all of the functions used in the MTBO. 

- `unit_test`: This directory contains the main functions for the benchmark method testing and MFBO physical training Python code.

- `MFGP_main.m`: This m function file is for MFBO physical training.

- `CPG_online.slx`: This .slx files contains simulink model used for SoftQ online training.

## Getting Started
